# triage-bot

An intelligent AI-powered triage bot that transforms your Slack support channels into efficient, automated help desks. Built with OpenAI integration, triage-bot automatically:

- üè∑Ô∏è **Tags the right people** - Identifies and notifies relevant on-call personnel
- üìä **Classifies issues** - Categorizes problems as bugs, features, questions, or incidents  
- üîç **Provides context** - Searches past discussions and suggests solutions
- üß† **Learns continuously** - Remembers team knowledge and improves over time
- üîß **Extends capabilities** - Integrates with external tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Perfect for engineering teams, customer support, and any organization looking to streamline their Slack-based support workflow.

## Quick Start

1. **Install triage-bot** (see [Installation](#installation) for platform-specific instructions)
2. **Set up prerequisites** (Node.js 20+ for MCP support, if you use `npx`)
3. **Configure your environment** (OpenAI API key, Slack tokens, database)
4. **Run the bot** and add it to your Slack channels

See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for detailed setup instructions.

## Installation

### Binary Installation

**Windows:**

```powershell
$ iwr https://github.com/twitchax/triage-bot/releases/latest/download/triage-bot_x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.zip
$ Expand-Archive triage-bot_x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.zip -DestinationPath C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\triage-bot
```

**macOS (Apple Silicon):**

```bash
$ curl -LO https://github.com/twitchax/triage-bot/releases/latest/download/triage-bot_aarch64-apple-darwin.zip
$ unzip triage-bot_aarch64-apple-darwin.zip -d /usr/local/bin
$ chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/triage-bot
```

**Linux:**

```bash
$ curl -LO https://github.com/twitchax/triage-bot/releases/latest/download/triage-bot_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.zip
$ unzip triage-bot_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.zip -d /usr/local/bin
$ chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/triage-bot
```

### From Source

**Using Cargo:**

```bash
$ cargo install triage-bot
```

## Prerequisites

**Node.js (Required for mainstream MCP Support)**

Triage-bot requires Node.js (version 20 or later) to run Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that use `npx` (fairly standard at the moment), which provide additional tools and capabilities to extend the bot's functionality.  If you use remote MCPs, or don't use `npx`, you can skip this requirement.

**Installation by Platform:**
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`
- **macOS**: `brew install node` (requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))
- **Windows**: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

**Other Requirements:**
- OpenAI API account with API key
- Slack workspace with bot permissions
- SurrealDB instance (for storing configurations and message history)

## How It Works

Triage-bot seamlessly integrates with your Slack workspace to provide intelligent support automation with minimal setup required.

### Basic Workflow

1. **Message Detection** - Bot monitors configured Slack channels for new messages
2. **AI Analysis** - Uses OpenAI models to understand the message context and urgency
3. **Intelligent Response** - Takes appropriate actions based on the analysis:
   - üè∑Ô∏è Tags relevant on-call personnel
   - üìÇ Classifies issues (Bug, Feature, Question, Incident, Other)
   - üîç Searches past discussions for relevant context
   - üí° Suggests potential solutions when confident
   - üìù Maintains conversation history for future reference

### Examples in Action

Here are real examples of how triage-bot operates in Slack channels:

#### üí¨ Basic Question Handling
![Basic Question](assets/basic_question.png)

The bot responds to straightforward questions with helpful information and context, automatically analyzing the message to provide relevant assistance.

#### üéØ Prime Directive and Channel Guidelines
![Prime Directive](assets/prime_directive.png)

Triage-bot follows a configurable "prime directive" that guides its behavior and priorities within each channel, ensuring consistent and appropriate responses.

#### üß† Adding Context and Memory
![Add Context](assets/add_context.png)

Users can teach the bot about their environment by adding context. The bot remembers this information and uses it to provide more accurate assistance in future interactions.

#### üîß Advanced Tool Support with MCP
![MCP Support](assets/mcp_support.png)

The bot integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to access additional tools and capabilities, extending its functionality beyond basic chat responses (e.g., deepwiki integration shown here).

#### üîç Detailed Execution Tracing
![Typical Trace](assets/typical_trace.png)

For transparency and debugging, triage-bot provides detailed execution traces showing how it processes messages and makes decisions. A typical trace shows the "back and forth" between the bot and the LLM, revealing how it arrives at responses.

### User Commands

Interact with triage-bot using these commands:

**Direct Mentions:**
- `@triage-bot why is my build failing?` - Ask for help with specific issues
- `@triage-bot please remember that FooService owns bar-api` - Add context and knowledge
- `@triage-bot reset the channel directive to prioritize security incidents` - Update channel behavior

**üí° Pro Tip:** The bot also responds to top-level comments that don't mention it directly, making conversations feel more natural.

## Configuration

Triage-bot can be configured using environment variables or a configuration file. Environment variables take precedence over config file values.

### Required Configuration

These settings are required for basic operation:

| Environment Variable              | Description                       | Example                 |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |

| Environment Variable                                 | Description                                     | Default   |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `TRIAGE_BOT_OPENAI_SEARCH_AGENT_MODEL`               | OpenAI model for search operations              | `gpt-4.1` |
| `TRIAGE_BOT_OPENAI_ASSISTANT_AGENT_MODEL`            | OpenAI model for assistant responses            | `o3`      |
| `TRIAGE_BOT_OPENAI_SEARCH_AGENT_TEMPERATURE`         | Creativity level for search agent (0.0-2.0)     | `0.0`     |
| `TRIAGE_BOT_OPENAI_ASSISTANT_AGENT_TEMPERATURE`      | Creativity level for assistant agent (0.0-2.0)  | `0.7`     |
| `TRIAGE_BOT_OPENAI_SEARCH_AGENT_REASONING_EFFORT`    | Reasoning depth for search (low/medium/high)    | `medium`  |
| `TRIAGE_BOT_OPENAI_ASSISTANT_AGENT_REASONING_EFFORT` | Reasoning depth for assistant (low/medium/high) | `medium`  |
| `TRIAGE_BOT_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS`                       | Maximum response length                         | `16384`   |

### Custom Directives

Customize bot behavior with these advanced options:

| Environment Variable                        | Description                              | Default  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `TRIAGE_BOT_SYSTEM_DIRECTIVE`               | Custom system prompt for assistant agent | Built-in |

| `TRIAGE_BOT_MESSAGE_SEARCH_AGENT_DIRECTIVE` | Custom message search behavior           | Built-in |

### Understanding Reasoning Models

**üìñ What are Reasoning Models?**
Reasoning effort parameters only apply to OpenAI's o-series models (like `o1`, `o3`) which are specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks.

**‚öôÔ∏è Reasoning Effort Levels:**
- `low` - Faster responses with basic reasoning
- `medium` - Balanced performance and reasoning depth (recommended)
- `high` - Deep reasoning at the cost of response time

**üîß Model Behavior:**
- **O-series models**: Use reasoning effort parameters for computational depth
- **GPT-series models**: Use temperature parameters for response creativity

### Configuration File Option

You can also use a `.hidden/config.toml` file instead of environment variables:

```toml
# Required settings
openai_api_key = "sk-your-api-key-here"
slack_app_token = "xapp-your-app-token"
slack_bot_token = "xoxb-your-bot-token"
slack_signing_secret = "your-signing-secret"
db_endpoint = "http://localhost:8000"
db_username = "root"
db_password = "root"

# Optional: Model configuration
openai_search_agent_model = "gpt-4o"
openai_assistant_agent_model = "o3"

# Optional: Reasoning effort for o-series models
openai_search_agent_reasoning_effort = "medium"
openai_assistant_agent_reasoning_effort = "high"
```

**üí° Priority:** Environment variables override config file values.

### Observability (Optional)

Enable monitoring and tracing with OpenTelemetry:

| Environment Variable          | Description                          | Example                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | OTLP endpoint URL for telemetry data | `http://localhost:4317`    |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` | Export protocol (grpc/http)          | `grpc`                     |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`  | Headers for OTLP requests            | `authorization=Bearer ...` |

These follow the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/) and work with platforms like Jaeger, Zipkin, or cloud tracing services.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Node.js** (version 20+) - Required for `npx` MCP server support
2. **Install triage-bot** using your preferred method ([see Installation](#installation))

**"Slack connection issues":**
- Ensure your Slack app has the correct permissions (chat:write, channels:read, etc.)
- Verify socket mode is enabled in your Slack app settings
- Check that tokens are correctly formatted (app token starts with `xapp-`, bot token with `xoxb-`)

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug triage-bot
```

## Architecture and Extensibility

Triage-bot is built with a modular, trait-based architecture that makes it easy to extend or replace components.

### Core Components

**üîå Default Implementations:**
- **Slack Integration** - Socket mode connection for real-time messaging
- **SurrealDB Storage** - Stores channel configs, context, and message history  
- **OpenAI Integration** - Powers AI responses and searches using latest models
- **MCP Support** - Extends capabilities through external tool servers

### Extensibility

**üîß Plugin Architecture:**
The application uses Rust traits for clean interfaces:

- `GenericChatClient` - Chat platform integration (Slack, Discord, Teams, etc.)
- `GenericDbClient` - Database operations (SurrealDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) 
- `GenericLlmClient` - LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.)

**üõ†Ô∏è Adding New Integrations:**
To add support for new services, implement the relevant trait:

```rust
use triage_bot::base::types::GenericChatClient;

struct MyCustomChatClient {
    // your implementation
}

impl GenericChatClient for MyCustomChatClient {
    // implement required methods
}
```

This modular design ensures triage-bot can adapt to your existing infrastructure and tooling.
